            <h1>About</h1>
            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>I'm a student at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Bhopal. Prior to joining IISERB, I attended Lalaji Memorial Omega International School, among other places. I enjoy reading novels. Currently, I'm reading science fiction and thrillers. I'm a huge fan of Arthur Clarke's works (Rendezvous with Rama has to be my favourite among all of his books!). I love mostly hard SF books that focus on technology and I'm not really into social SF. But, really, I'm always looking for good book recommendations. So, if you have any, do share them with me, regardless of genre!</p>
            <p>I love maths. In particular, I enjoy studying algebra. Currently, I'm exploring the representation theory of finite groups. I am particularly fascinated by the logical nature of mathematical proofs. Just the way everything clicks into place to prove a theorem is something I find to be fun! I also (infrequently) solve some competitive programming problems from sites like Codeforces, Project Euler, etc.</p>
            <p>I also looove chocolate, in any form! There really is nothing like sitting out in the open on a chilly/rainy day and reading a good book whilst sipping some hot chocolate. I claim the hot chocolate is to warm my body and the book is to warm my heart! :)</p>
            <h2>What is this site about?</h2>
            <p>This website is a place to collect my writings. It serves to collect my mathematical musings and anything else I find noteworthy. There is not really any fixed frequency with which I'll post new articles. New articles will be posted whenever they are posted, even I don't know when I'll feel like writing one.</p>
