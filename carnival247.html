            <h1>Carnival of Mathematics 247</h1>
            <p>
              It is a new month, and with it comes a new Carnival! Before we enjoy the carnival in its entirety, we shall stake out the surroundings a bit.
              What is this number, 247?
              <br>
              It is a Harshad number, which means it is divisible by the sum of its digits. Indeed, that is so, for \(247=19 \times 13\). Yet another fun fact, 'harshad' means 'joy giver' in Sanskrit.
              An appropriate number for a carnival, one might suppose. Here is an interesting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgwevhEykWQ">Numberphile video on Harshad numbers featuring Tony Padilla</a>.
              <br>
              This is also the start of a new year, 2026, in the Gregorian calendar. A look at the OEIS tells us that there is a connection between 247 and 2026.
              Let \(a(n)\) be the number of ways one can write \(n\) as an ordered sum of 1s, 2s, 3s and 4s such that no 2 precedes any 1 and no 3 precedes any 1 or 2.
              Now 247 factors as: \(247=13\times 19\) and  we have \(247 = a(13)\), \(2026 = a(19)\). More details on the sequence of \(a(i)\)'s are here: <a href="https://oeis.org/A123569">A123569</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is now time to explore the Carnival's mainstays. Hopefully this carnival is also a harshad, like 247! :)
              <h2>Formalisation of Erdős Problems</h2>
              A blog post by <a href="https://borisalexeev.com/">Boris Alexeev</a> on the value of collaboration and AI in formalisation, with particular focus on Erdős problems. This post provides a brief update on the recent developments in this field.
              Find it here: <a href="https://xenaproject.wordpress.com/2025/12/05/formalization-of-erdos-problems/">Post on the Xena Project</a>.
              <h2>The Equational Theories Project</h2>
              Launched by Terence Tao in September 2024 (<a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2024/09/25/a-pilot-project-in-universal-algebra-to-explore-new-ways-to-collaborate-and-use-machine-assistance/">Initial post</a> and an <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2024/10/12/the-equational-theories-project-a-brief-tour/">update</a>, this was featured in <a href="https://www.jeremykun.com/2022/11/01/carnival-of-mathematics-233/">Carnival 233</a>), he now reports on its completion: <a href="https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2025/12/09/the-equational-theories-project-advancing-collaborative-mathematical-research-at-scale/">Post on his blog</a>.
              <h2>Notes on Probability</h2>
              Brian Sutin from Skewray Research has made available their notes on probability theory here: <a href="https://www.skewray.com/articles/notes-on-probability">Skewray Research</a>. This builds upon an <a href="https://www.skewray.com/articles/randomness-is-an-inverse-stochastic-process">earlier post on clowns</a> which featured in <a href="https://tommaths.blogspot.com/2025/12/carnival-of-mathematics-246.html">Carnival 246</a>, but can be read in isolation.
              <h2>Winning Lotteries Twice</h2>
              While it is unlikely for a specific person to win the lottery twice (about 1 in 24 trillion!), this article is explains why it is not as unlikely for the lottery to be won twice (by a non-specific somebody). Read it here: <a href="https://kityates.substack.com/p/just-how-unlikely-is-it-to-win-the">Kit Yates' substack post</a>.
              <h2>The Rado Graph</h2>
              The Rado graph is a graph with countably infinite edges that contains an isomorphic copy of any arbitrary finite graph. A bold claim! Matt Parker has published a video that walks us through proving this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNWl-0rle4A">You can prove every possible graph is just a sub-graph.</a>
              <h2>Exploitation and Game Theory</h2>
              Rodrigo Treviño has published a note in The Mathematical Intelligencer recounting their experience with an exploitative seller, and a way to retain the upper hand: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00283-025-10457-3">How to Not Let Them Get Away With It: A Note on the Mathematics of Infinite Exploitation. Math Intelligencer (2025) (Open access)</a>.
              <h2>Christmas Cracker Calculator</h2>
              Laura has published an article on their blog, <em>Letters and Words</em>, about how a set of magic trick cards was a binary calculator in disguise! Here's the link to their article: <a href="https://lettersandwords.co.uk/2025/12/31/christmas-cracker-calculator/">Christmas Cracker Calculator</a>.
              <h2>Highlights of 2025</h2>
              The team at <a href="https://mathateca.nz/">Mathateca</a> have shared a list of maths stuff that they loved from 2025 <a href="https://mathateca.nz/Blog/Mathatecas-Best-of-the-Web-2025/">here.</a>
              <br>
              Quanta magazine has published their <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-year-in-mathematics-20251218/">Year in Mathematics</a> article, part of the 2025 in Review series.

                That's it for this carnival, I hope it was fun. The fun doesn't end here though. Carnival 248 will be hosted by Laura Walsh, and you can submit entries <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?pli=1&formkey=dC1IREpjV1lVRE1xcml2bXJDUzhqTXc6MQ#gid=0">here.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                My thanks go to Robin Whitty, Skewray, Mathateca and Laura Walsh who submitted entries for this Carnival of Mathematics. I am also grateful to Ioanna, Katie and the team at The Aperiodical for organising the Carnivals.
