            <h1>Corra Compares Contour Integrals, A proof of the Cauchy-Goursat theorem</h1>
            <p>This articles assumes familiarity with the concepts of complex functions, their continuity, differentiability and contour integration at an early undergraduate level.  It is aimed at a student taking an introductory course on complex analysis. It was my entry for SoMEπ, held in 2024, and was ranked 21 of 44 non video entries.

            <h3>Corrections:</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The energy function defined in (2) on page 1 should be a function from the complex plane to the complex plane, and not from the integers to the integers. Thanks anonymous SoME reviewer for pointing out the mistake.
                    </li>
                    <li>Also on page 1, (3) initially had an error which implied the contour integral is a real number. The contour integral is a complex number and the error is now fixed. Thanks anonymous SoME reviewer for pointing this out.
                    </li>
                    <li>The extension of the proof to arbitrary simple closed contours does not work as presented here as I have not shown that despite the contribution of each partial square becoming smaller, the sum of all the contributions is still not significant. Thanks anonymous Redditor for highlighting this error.
                    </li>

            <h3>Acknowledgements:</h3>
            <p>I was first exposed to this theorem in my complex analysis course. The proof for triangles is based on the discussions in the classes.
            </p>
            <p>The extension to arbitrary simple closed contours is my original attempt.
